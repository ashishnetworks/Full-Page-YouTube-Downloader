# YouTube-Full-Page-Downloader

## What does it do?
Allows users to download all the videos of front page for the specific keyword

Lets consider you want to download all the videos of front page for any topic then we will have to search youtube for those
keywords and then copy link for each of those videos and then finally we will have to use any software to download
video from each specific link, right? But not so now !! Forget the pain of manual work. I made a program which does all the above
work in just single step. Excited?

## How to download our code
`git clone https://github.com/ashishnetworks/YouTube-Full-Page-Downloader
`
## How to install
``cd YouTube-Full-Page-Downloader``

``python setup install
``
## How to run
`python yfpd.py "title or any keyword"
`

Downloading should have started by now.
