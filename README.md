# Full-Page-YouTube-Downloader
Allows users to download all the vidios of front page for the specific keyword
Lets consider you want to dowlload all the vidios of front page for few keywords then we will have to search youtube for those
keywords and then copy the download link for each of the vidio and then finally we will have to use some software to downoload 
vidio from each specific link right? But not so now !! Forget the pain of manual work. I have a program which does all the above 
work in just single step. Exited?

# How to install
python setup install

# How to run
python yfpd.py "Keywords title"

Downloading should have started by now.

Feel free to edit and improve code and documentation. I would be happy to resolve any error if occured
